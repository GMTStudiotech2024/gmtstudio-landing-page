    ['ai', "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is the result of our efforts to automate tasks normally performed by humans, such as image pattern recognition, document classification, or a computerized chess rival. Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning - Deep Learning - Symbolic AI  (Fig. 1) AI encompasses various approaches: Symbolic AI, also referred to as good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI), uses explicitly defined rules and symbolic representations for problem-solving. It's similar to traditional programming in the sense that predefined guidelines drive the process, however it's more advanced as it permits inference and adaptation to new situations. Machine Learning (ML) is another AI approach that allows algorithms to learn from data. Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses multi-layered, artificial neural networks."],
