    ['machine learning', "Machine Learning, or ML, focuses on the creation of systems or models that can learn from data and improve their performance in specific tasks, without the need to be explicitly programmed, making them learn from past experiences or examples to make decisions on new data. This differs from traditional programming, where human programmers write rules in code, transforming the input data into desired results Now, I am going to explain the most relevant terms in ML: Model: A model is the representation that explains the observations. The trained model is the result of applying an ML algorithm with a data set. This trained model, now primed with specific patterns and understandings from the dataset, is subsequently used to draw inferences from new observations.  Algorithm: An algorithm is a procedure implemented in code that guides a model in learning from data it's given. There are many machine learning algorithms.  Training: Training is the iterative process of applying the learning algorithm. Consists in: * Applying the model (as is) to the variables of the observations and obtain the results according to the model. * Comparing the model results with the actual values. * Establishing a way to calculate the error between the model and reality. * Using the error as a basis to update the model in order to reduce the error. * Repeating until the model reaches the error levels that we have proposed and is capable of generalizing with observations that it has not seen in training."],
