The trained model is the result of applying an ML algorithm with a data set. This trained model, now primed with specific patterns and understandings from the dataset, is subsequently used to draw inferences from new observations.  Algorithm: An algorithm is a procedure implemented in code that guides a model in learning from data it's given. There are many machine learning algorithms.  Training: Training is the iterative process of applying the learning algorithm. Consists in: * Applying the model (as is) to the variables of the observations and obtain the results according to the model. * Comparing the model results with the actual values. * Establishing a way to calculate the error between the model and reality. * Using the error as a basis to update the model in order to reduce the error. * Repeating until the model reaches the error levels that we have proposed and is capable of generalizing with observations that it has not seen in training."],
